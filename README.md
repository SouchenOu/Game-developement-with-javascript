Document Object Model:
------------------------------------

*Document.querySelectorAll('.example'): means Select all elements with class="example"

*The classList property itself is read-only, you can modify its associated DOMTokenList using the add(), remove(), replace(), and toggle() methods.

*The Math.random() function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number that's greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1, with approximately uniform distribution over that range â€” which you can then scale to your desired range.
